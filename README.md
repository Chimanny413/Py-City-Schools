# PyCitySchools Analysis

## Overview

This project is a data analysis challenge focused on evaluating school performance across a city’s school district. The goal is to provide actionable insights into school performance based on standardized test data, student demographics, and school budgets. The analysis was conducted using Python, leveraging the Pandas library and Jupyter Notebook for data processing, exploration, and reporting.

## Key Analysis

### 1. District Summary

Calculated district-wide metrics:
- Total number of unique schools.
- Total number of students.
- Total budget.
- Average math and reading scores.
- Percentages of students passing math, reading, and both subjects.

### 2. School Summary

Analyzed each school’s performance by:
- School type and size.
- Total and per-student budgets.
- Average scores and passing rates for math and reading.

### 3. Performance Breakdown

#### Top and Bottom Schools:
- Identified the top 5 and bottom 5 schools based on overall passing percentages.

#### Scores by Grade:
- Analyzed average math and reading scores for each grade level (9th-12th) at every school.

#### Scores by Spending:
- Categorized schools into spending bins and analyzed their performance:
  - <$585
  - $585-630
  - $630-645
  - $645-680

#### Scores by School Size:
- Segmented schools by size:
  - Small (<1000 students)
  - Medium (1000-2000 students)
  - Large (2000-5000 students)

#### Scores by School Type:
- Grouped schools by type (Charter vs. District) to analyze performance.

## Key Results

1. **Overall Trends:**
   - Charter schools outperform district schools in terms of both math and reading passing rates.
   - Smaller schools generally achieve higher passing rates compared to larger schools.

2. **Budget Efficiency:**
   - Schools with lower per-student budgets often perform better, indicating that spending efficiency may play a significant role.
